Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with AI

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game using Python and Pygame, where the player can play against an AI.

Implementation:
The interface was created with Pygame.
There are three buttons: Rock, Paper and Scissors.
When the player clicks a button; at the first three game AI chooses randomly and then it chooses depending on the game history.
The program compares both moves and shows the result on the screen.
The winner is shown on page after each round.
The winner and scores are updated after each round. 

Conclusion:
This project shows how to make a simple interactive game with Pygame and basic AI logic. It helped me understand event handling and game loops in Python.
